Leo is my archival program. It creates tar(1) files from a pre-defined
list. It can encrypt/sign files with gpg2(1).

═══════════════

  `%dispatch' has the pre-defined list. Learn the list directly from
  `leo.pl', it's self-explanatory. Or check the sub `HelpMessage', it
  explains what each command does.

  For example, `documents' will archive `$ENV{HOME}/documents' to
  `/tmp/archive/documents_$ymd.tar' where `$ymd' is current date in
  `YYYY-MM-DD' format.
  ┌────
  │ my %dispatch = (
  │     "documents" => sub {
  │         tar_create("/tmp/archive/documents_$ymd.tar",
  │                    "-C", "$ENV{HOME}/documents", ".");
  │     },
  │     ...
  │ )
  └────

  I use this to quickly archive some of my files & copy them to another
  computer as a backup.


1.1 encrypt/sign
────────────────

  `encrypt_sign' handles `gpg2' related functions. It passes `--yes' by
  default.

  *Note*: `gpg2' might compress the archives depending on your config.
   Default is to enable compression, if you don't want this then add `-z
   0' to `@options'. `-z' specifies the compression level & 0 means no
   compression.


1.2 delete
──────────

  Removes the archive file after running gpg2(1). This means that either
  `encrypt' or `sign' option must be passed.


1.3 help
────────

  Running just `leo' will print help.


2 History
═════════

  This was Leo's initial description:

        Leo is a program to run my personal scripts. You might not
        find them useful, these were previously shell scripts that
        I rewrote in Perl.

  I had created a sync function initially & was going to expand it. Then
  I decided to remove those sync functions because it was too complex, I
  replaced then with simple `sh' scripts.

  I added a simple `archive' function later & decided to turn Leo into
  that function. So, it's not a meta-program anymore. I was thinking of
  creating something that does all the things for me but that'll be too
  complex.
