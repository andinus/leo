Leo is a program to run my personal scripts. You might not find them
useful, these were previously shell scripts that I rewrote in Perl.

═══════════════

  There is a main dispatch table (`%dispatch') which has all the
  functions.


1.1 archive
───────────

  `archive' creates tar(1) files from a pre-defined list.
  `%archive_dispatch' contains that list.

  For example, `documents' will archive `$ENV{HOME}/documents' to
  `/tmp/archive/documents_$ymd.tar' where `$ymd' is current date in
  `YYYY-MM-DD' format.
  ┌────
  │ my %archive_dispatch = (
  │     "documents" => sub {
  │         tar_create("/tmp/archive/documents_$ymd.tar",
  │                    "-C", "$ENV{HOME}/documents", ".");
  │     },
  │     ...
  │ )
  └────

  I use this to quickly archive some of my files & copy them to another
  computer as a backup.

  There is no encryption or compression but it can be added directly to
  `tar_create' function. I plan to add some encryption later. Currently
  I store them locally (offline) so it's not required.


1.2 help
────────

  Running just `leo' will print help. There is help message for
  functions too, run `leo <function>' to print their help message. For
  example, `leo archive' will print `archive''s help message.


1.3 removed
───────────

  This contains the list of functions that were removed.


1.3.1 sync functions
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  There were sync functions, they synced some of my files to remote
  servers. I replaced it with simple `sh' scripts instead.
